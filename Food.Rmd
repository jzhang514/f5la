# Program Officer and Grantee Perspectives

*	Access to food is an urgent issue that families in all five regions face. The primary barriers to food access are the cost and transportation.
*	Many families live far from grocery stores and rely on public transportation to access food. This creates heightened challenges during the pandemic as many families opt out of riding public transit for fear of catching Covid-19.
*	Many food banks and agencies recognized the high need for food and set up distribution centers during the beginning of the pandemic. However, it is not easy for families to obtain reliable information about where newly available food resources are. This forces many service providers, Program Officers and Regional Network Grantees to operate as coordinators of information to ensure that families are connected to services closest to them.
*	Progress on food access helps achieve [<nobr style="color: #04B2D9;">__First 5 LAâ€™s Result: Family Resources.__</nobr>](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/7BCF9E27-DD6A-442D-BD86-AF6566D0C38B?tenantId=abc23eed-8c00-4a99-892a-09219a95119e&fileType=pdf&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ffirst5lacounty.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FAdvancementProject%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2Fresults_for_children_and_families.pdf&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ffirst5lacounty.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FAdvancementProject&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:1e7e7b70c7eb4cb6b2e851e41582db4f@thread.skype&groupId=1f9a4169-31de-476b-a42f-e2f7da7fce74) This indicator is similar to the Impact Framework's Food Insecurity indicator.

# Food Insecurity by Race and Ethnicity

Among families who are at or below 300% of the Federal Poverty Line, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Latinx, and Black families are most likely to report food insecurity. For more information, the Los Angeles [Food Policy Council's 2020 Food System Dashboard](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bc50618ab1a624d324ecd81/t/5e45c5915750af6b4e5e5c4b/1581630905550/2020FoodSystemDashboard.pdf) paints a comprehensive picture of food systems in Los Angeles and the landscape of food access and distribution using a racial equity lens. <br>
